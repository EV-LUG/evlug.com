# About

Evansville Linux User Group is a free and open group of Linux and computer enthusiasts. We meet on the third Friday of every month (unless otherwise noted) at 318 Main St, Evansville, IN 47708. EVLUG was built around the idea of bringing together like-minded individuals in the community to network and learn from one another. We welcome those of any level of skill sets, and encourage members to give presentations on what excites them. Feel free to come hang out with us at our next meeting!
